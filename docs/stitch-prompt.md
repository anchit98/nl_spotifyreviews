# Google Stitch Design Brief — Spotify Music Discovery Insights Dashboard

## Project overview

Design a **highly interactive, modern web dashboard** (desktop-first, fully responsive) for **Spotify product teams, executives, and user researchers**.

The product answers **six strategic research questions** about why users struggle with **meaningful music discovery** and why a significant share of listening still comes from **repeat playlists, familiar artists, and previously discovered tracks**, using evidence from **~23,000 cleaned public reviews** collected from five sources:

- **App Store**
- **Google Play**
- **Reddit**
- **Community Forums**
- **Social Media**

This is **not** the consumer Spotify app. It is an **internal insights explorer** — a live control panel for user voice, not a static report or wiki page.

**UI is a first-class priority.** The interface should feel as polished and interactive as products like **Linear**, **Vercel Analytics**, or **Stripe Dashboard** — dark, confident, motion-rich, and explorable. Avoid boring text-heavy layouts.

**Tech context (for realism):** Next.js on Vercel, FastAPI on Render, data from Supabase. All content is API-driven.

---

## Design system direction

Use a **hybrid design system**:

| Layer | Reference | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Visual polish & hierarchy** | Apple Human Interface Guidelines | Typography, spacing, calm premium feel, readable long-form text |
| **Components & interaction** | Material Design 3 | Chips, buttons, dialogs, progress, snackbars, data tables, tooltips |
| **Layout energy & density** | Linear / Vercel / Stripe dashboards | Bento grids, animated metrics, master-detail layouts, dark data UI |

### Visual tokens

- **Mode:** Dark mode primary (design light mode optional as secondary)
- **Background:** `#0A0A0B` to `#000000`
- **Surface / cards:** `#1C1C1E`, `#2C2C2E` (layered elevation, not flat gray slabs)
- **Borders:** `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` — subtle
- **Primary accent:** Spotify green `#1DB954` — CTAs, active states, chart highlights only
- **Secondary accent:** Teal/cyan for charts and secondary data series
- **Warning:** Amber for low-confidence data badges
- **Error:** Soft red for failed synthesis (not alarming)
- **Typography:** SF Pro or **Inter**
  - H1 (question titles): 28–34px, semibold
  - Theme sentences: 17–19px, medium — **hero readable content**
  - Body narrative: 15–17px, line-height 1.5–1.6
  - Metadata / counts: 13px, muted (`#8E8E93` or similar)
- **Radius:** 16–20px on cards; 999px on chips/pills
- **Icons:** Lucide-style line icons (source, status, export, refresh)
- **Hero only:** Very subtle mesh gradient (deep green → black); optional light glass blur on primary CTA card
- **Do not** clone the consumer Spotify app UI. Green is an accent, not the whole brand skin.

### Motion & micro-interactions (spec explicitly)

| Interaction | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Page load | Staggered card fade-up (60–80ms delay per card) |
| Metric numbers | Count-up animation (e.g. 0 → 23,166) |
| Theme bar chart | Bars animate width from 0 on scroll-into-view |
| Card hover | Lift 2px + subtle green glow on border |
| Theme selection | Cross-fade detail panel (~200ms ease) |
| Filter chips | Selected chip fills accent; filtered content cross-fades |
| Chart hover | Tooltip + dim non-hovered segments |
| Synthesize button | Morphs to circular progress ring when running |
| Navigation | Shared-element transition from home question card → question header |
| Quote expand | Full-screen modal with backdrop blur |

**Avoid:** parallax, constant looping animation, neon/cyberpunk, 3D charts, glassmorphism everywhere.

## Audience & jobs to be done

**Primary users**

- Product managers — headline answers, ranked themes, copy-paste narratives
- User researchers — quotes, source breakdowns, confidence cues
- Executives — 30-second overview: pain points, opportunities, last updated

**Core jobs**

1. See all **six questions** and top themes at a glance
2. **Click** into any question and explore **5 ranked themes** interactively
3. Filter evidence by **source** and **rating**
4. Read **verbatim anonymised quotes** tied to each theme
5. Trigger **“Synthesize now”** from the home header to refresh with the latest 7 days of feedback
6. **Export Report** as a multi-page PDF for stakeholders
7. Ask **PM Buddy** evidence-backed questions about why discovery is hard and why repetitive listening persists
8. Track **synthesis run history** and **live review trends** over time

---

## Information architecture — screens to design

Design **11 screens** (desktop + mobile for key screens) with **interaction notes** on each.

---

### Screen 1: Executive Overview (Home) — `/`

**Layout:** Modern **bento grid** — asymmetric card sizes, not a single scrolling document.

**Header (persistent)**

- Product name: **Spotify Review Analysis Engine** (sidebar) / **Music Discovery Insights** (home header)
- Subtitle: *Why discovery is hard and why listening still clusters on repeat playlists, familiar artists, and previously discovered tracks.*
- Right side: **Export Report** (secondary) + **Synthesize now** (primary filled button) + run status indicator dot (green/amber/red)
- Metadata strip: `23,166 reviews` · `Last updated: 16 Jun 2026, 14:32 UTC` · `Run: Success`

**Sidebar navigation:** Home · PM Buddy · Trends · History · Q1–Q6 — Spotify logo (`/app-logo.webp`) + title **Spotify Review Analysis Engine**

**Bento grid cards:**

**A. Hero metrics row (4 animated tiles)**

- Reviews analyzed (count-up)
- Questions answered: `6/6`
- Themes surfaced: `30`
- Avg rating (discovery-related): `2.5★`

**B. Executive summary card**

- 3–5 sentence narrative centred on the primary research agenda (discovery struggle + repetitive listening fallback)
- Opens with headline insight on why discovery fails or why familiar content dominates — not generic product complaints
- **Copy narrative** icon button

**C. Top pain points (interactive)**

- Horizontal **ranked bar chart** (not bullet list)
- Hover bar → tooltip with count + quote preview
- Top 3 pain points

**D. Top opportunities (interactive)**

- Same pattern as pain points
- Action-oriented icons per row

**E. Source mix donut (interactive)**

- Shared `SourceMixDonut` component — **large donut centred above** a full-width legend (vertical stack, not side-by-side)
- 5 segments: App Store, Google Play, Reddit, Community Forum, Social Media
- Centre label shows total review count
- Click legend row → highlight when interactive (question pages)

**F. Six question preview cards (2×3 grid desktop, stack mobile)**

Each card:

- `Q1` badge + short title
- Top theme preview (1 line, truncated)
- Mention count badge (e.g. `1,150`)
- Mini sparkline placeholder (trend)
- Hover: lift + green accent border
- Click: navigate to question detail (shared-element transition)

**Interaction notes:** Home should feel alive on load — metrics count up, bars animate in, cards stagger. No static PDF energy.

---

### Screens 2–7: Question Detail — `/questions/q1` … `/questions/q6`

**Use one consistent template** for all six. This is the **flagship screen** — spend the most design effort here.

**Questions (exact copy):**

| ID | Question |
|---|---|
| Q1 | Why do users struggle to discover new music? |
| Q2 | What are the most common frustrations with recommendations? |
| Q3 | What listening behaviors are users trying to achieve? |
| Q4 | What causes users to repeatedly listen to the same content? |
| Q5 | Which user segments experience different discovery challenges? |
| Q6 | What unmet needs emerge consistently across reviews? |

**Layout: Master-detail split (desktop)**

**Top 5 themes component (hero)**

Each theme row:

- Rank `#1–#5`
- **Animated horizontal bar** proportional to mention count
- **Full layman sentence** (12–30 words) — NOT a 3-word label  
  Example: *“Users on the free tier are frustrated with the frequent and intrusive ads that interrupt their music experience.”*
- Mention count badge (e.g. `1,202 mentions`)
- Selected state: green left border + filled background tint

**Click theme row →** detail panel cross-fades with:

- Full theme sentence
- 1-line summary
- Example quote card (source badge + star rating)
- Source mini-chart for that theme
- Copy / Export buttons

**Optional:** “Play through themes” auto-advance button (like a guided walkthrough for execs).

**Answer narrative**

- Collapsible card (default: expanded on desktop, collapsed on mobile)
- **Copy narrative** button

**Charts (interactive, synced with filters)**

- **Source breakdown:** stacked or horizontal bar — hover tooltips, click to filter quotes
- **Rating distribution:** histogram — click 1★ bar → show low-rating quotes only

**Quote gallery**

- Horizontal scroll with snap points (App Store–style card carousel)
- Quote cards: elevated surface, quotation styling, source icon, star rating, date
- Tap card → full-screen quote modal (Screen 9)
- Filters via chips update gallery + charts in real time

**Key findings**

- 3–5 expandable accordion items: finding + evidence line

**Mobile:** Stack master-detail vertically; themes list on top; detail panel below selected theme; charts stack; quote gallery remains horizontal scroll.

---

### Screen 8: Trends — `/trends`

- **Dual-axis chart** (Recharts): net sentiment line (rating-based, −100 to +100) + average rating bars
- **Granularity toggle:** Weekly · Monthly · Yearly — buckets from live `clean.feedback_items` by posting date
- Tooltips show review volume, positive/neutral/negative split, and avg rating per period
- **Empty state:** when no dated reviews exist in the selected range
- **Note:** sentiment is a star-rating proxy (4–5★ positive, 3★ neutral, 1–2★ negative), not Groq text analysis

---

### Screen 9: PM Buddy — `/pm-buddy`

- Chat layout: message thread + input bar
- Copilot focused on **why meaningful discovery is hard** and **why listening falls back to repeat playlists, familiar artists, and previously discovered tracks**
- Default answers: direct answer + supporting evidence (quotes and counts). **No** segment breakdown or testable-hypothesis sections unless the user explicitly asks
- Starter prompts framed as “why” questions; segment prompt available for on-demand segment analysis
- Answers cite dataset stats and verbatim quotes from the evidence context
- Empty state when `GROQ_API_KEY` is not configured (503 from backend)
- Sidebar link between Home and Trends

---

### Screen 10: Run History — `/runs`

- Material-style **data table**: date, status pill, reviews analyzed, tokens used, duration
- Row expand → mini timeline of that run’s steps
- Failed rows: expandable error snippet
- **Compare runs** checkbox mode → side-by-side diff view
- Link each row → view insights from that run

---

### Screen 11: Synthesize Flow (modals / overlays)

**State 1 — Confirm dialog**

- Title: “Synthesize new insights?”
- Body: Collects last **7 days** of public feedback, re-runs cleaning and analysis. Takes ~2–3 minutes.
- Buttons: Cancel · **Start synthesis**

**State 2 — Already running**

- Dialog: “Synthesis in progress” — disable second run
- Show link to run status

**State 3 — In progress (banner + card)**

- Sticky top banner: linear progress + steps `Collecting → Cleaning → Synthesizing`
- Home header Synthesize button shows ring progress while running

**State 4 — Success snackbar**

- “Insights updated” + timestamp + “View results” action

**State 5 — Failed**

- Soft error card: “Synthesis incomplete” + retry button + error snippet

---

### Screen 11: Quote Expanded Modal

- Full-screen or large centered modal, backdrop blur
- Large quote text
- Source badge, rating stars, posted date
- **Previous / Next** navigation within filtered set
- Close button + swipe down on mobile

---

### Screen 12: Empty & Loading States

Design all of these (with shimmer skeletons, not spinners alone):

- **No data yet** — before first synthesis run
- **Question with zero mentions** — “Not enough data for this question”
- **Low confidence** — amber badge when source sample is thin (e.g. Reddit n=4)
- **Loading skeleton** — home bento grid, theme bars, quote cards
- **Cold start loading** — Home and Trends show synthesis-style progress screen while Render backend wakes (30–60s on Starter tier)
- **Partial run** — 6/7 questions complete, executive summary missing

---

## Data model — use realistic placeholder content

### Executive summary

Executive summaries must open with why discovery is hard and/or why repetitive listening persists. Example shape:

```json
{
  "summary_text": "A significant share of reviews describe falling back to repeat playlists and familiar artists because recommendations feel repetitive and discovery surfaces are hard to trust. Users who mention struggling to find new music often cite the same recommendation loops and shuffle behaviour that keep previously discovered tracks in rotation.\n\nThe loudest frustrations cluster around recommendation quality and playback control — both of which push listeners toward content they already know rather than meaningful new discovery.",
  "top_pain_points": [
    "Recommendations recycle the same artists and genres, so users stop trusting discovery and return to repeat playlists",
    "Shuffle and repeat behaviour on large playlists reinforces listening to previously discovered tracks",
    "Free-tier ad interruptions break discovery sessions and send users back to familiar content"
  ],
  "top_opportunities": [
    "Break recommendation loops with fresher Discover Weekly and Release Radar personalization",
    "Surface discovery paths that reward exploration instead of defaulting to liked songs",
    "Reduce friction between finding a new track and adding it to a durable discovery playlist"
  ]
}
```

### Per-question theme (5 per question)

```json
{
  "theme": "Users receive suggestions for genres or songs they clearly do not like, indicating a lack of understanding of their music preferences.",
  "mention_count": 337,
  "summary": "Many users say playlists play random songs they did not add.",
  "example_quote": "I don't have Spotify premium but come on, a playlist is for a specific group of songs and now it plays random songs I don't like."
}
```

### Stats block (per question)

```json
{
  "total_mentions": 4805,
  "avg_rating": 2.53,
  "low_rating_count": 3200,
  "by_source": {
    "google_play": 4200,
    "app_store": 312,
    "reddit": 180,
    "community_forum": 64,
    "social_media": 49
  },
  "rating_distribution": {
    "1": 1200, "2": 900, "3": 1100, "4": 800, "5": 805
  }
}
```

### Quote object

```json
{
  "text": "Shuffle is rubbish, make a playlist with 47 hours of songs and every time you play you hear the same songs.",
  "source": "google_play",
  "rating": 2,
  "posted_at": "2026-05-12"
}
```

## Sample content — Q2 (use on question detail mock)

**Stats:** 4,805 mentions · 2.53★ avg · 3,200 low ratings

**Narrative excerpt:**  
*“Recommendation frustrations are widespread across Google Play reviews. Users most often blame the algorithm for repetitive or irrelevant suggestions. A smaller group praises curated mixes like Discover Weekly when they work well.”*

**Top 5 themes (real data):**

1. **751** — Users experience poor quality recommendations that do not meet their expectations.
2. **664** — The algorithm is blamed for suggesting music that feels wrong, repetitive, or out of touch with the user's taste.
3. **337** — Users receive suggestions for genres or songs they clearly do not like, indicating a lack of understanding of their music preferences.
4. **100** — Listeners complain that recommendations and mixes keep serving the same songs instead of surfacing fresh music.
5. **78** — Users refer to curated playlists like Discover Weekly when talking about recommendations.

**Sample quotes:**

- *“stop using algorithms! I am a premium user with over 2,000 songs on my playlist and I hear the same 100 to 200 songs every single day.”* — Google Play, 2★
- *“Every single update this app is getting worse. Discover weekly was always on the front page. Where is it now?”* — Google Play, 3★

---

## UX rules (non-negotiable)

1. **No chart without a “so what”** — one plain-English line under every chart
2. **Every theme shows mention count** — frequency drives prioritization
3. **Quotes are first-class UI** — carousel, modal, filterable — not footnotes
4. **Everything clickable filters something** — theme → quotes; source → charts + quotes; rating bar → angry quotes
5. **Low-confidence data** gets amber badge (thin segment, e.g. n<20)
6. **PII masked** in quotes (`[EMAIL]`) — UI must not break on placeholders
7. **Synthesize button** on home header only — disabled while run in progress; tooltip explains why
8. **Export Report** on home header — multi-page PDF of home, questions, and trends
9. **Export everywhere** narratives and themes are shown (copy buttons on cards)
10. **Avoid wiki layouts** — no 800px single column of uninterrupted text

---

## Responsive breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Desktop 1280px+ | Bento grid, master-detail split, sidebar nav |
| Tablet 768–1279px | Single column, charts stack, quote carousel remains horizontal |
| Mobile <768px | Hamburger nav, stacked themes + detail, bottom sheet for filters |

---

## Accessibility

- WCAG AA contrast on dark backgrounds
- Charts use pattern + color (not color alone)
- Keyboard-focusable: theme rows, chips, Synthesize, quote modal
- Screen reader labels: “Theme 1 of 5, 751 mentions, recommendation quality”
- Reduced motion variant: disable count-up and bar animations, keep cross-fades minimal

---

## Deliverables requested from Stitch

1. **Design system page** — colors, type scale, spacing, radius, elevation, motion tokens
2. **Component sheet** — all 19 components with states (default, hover, selected, disabled, loading)
3. **Desktop mockups** — all screens listed above
4. **Mobile mockups** — Home + Question Detail + Quote Modal
5. **Interaction flow diagram** — Synthesize now (idle → confirm → progress → success/fail)
6. **Prototype notes** — which elements click/filter/navigate where
7. **Do not design** login/auth screens (SSO later)

---

## Style references (mood board)

Combine the best of:

- **Linear** — interaction density, dark polish, fast feel
- **Vercel Analytics** — clean charts, dark surfaces
- **Stripe Dashboard** — confident metrics, great tables
- **Apple Health** — ring progress, card hierarchy (for synthesis status)
- **Material 3 expressive** — chips, dialogs, motion specs

**Not:** consumer Spotify app, wiki/docs page, static PDF report, generic admin Bootstrap panel.

---

## One-line creative north star

> *“A premium, interactive command center for understanding what users are saying about music discovery — where every number opens a story, every theme is a button, and every quote is one click away.”*

---

## Usage note

If Stitch has a character limit, start with **Screen 1 (Home)**, **Screen 2 (Question Detail template)**, and the **Design system** section — those three carry the most visual weight.
